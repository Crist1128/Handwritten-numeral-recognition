# Handwritten-numeral-recognition

This project is a handwritten digit recognition application based on deep learning technology. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to hand-write numbers on a canvas and then recognize the drawn numbers through a pre-trained convolutional neural network model. This project has the following main functions:

1. Users can draw handwritten numbers on the canvas.
2. The project provides a Clear button that allows the user to clear the canvas to redraw the numbers.
3. The drawn numbers will be identified by a pre-trained deep learning model.
4. Recognition results will be displayed on the interface to help users understand the numbers they have drawn.

## Instructions for use

Download mnist_model_20.h5, canvas.py, main.py, and install the relevant packages in python to run main.py for multi-digit recognition
